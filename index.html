<p>At last my time trans-location side arm was complete! I quickly moved to my bedroom and moved the giant chest of drawers and fired at the large wall it once was previously obstructing... and lept in. I ended up at the 1964 worlds fair--a curious affair filled with technology that seemed like magic to my mind. And that's when a man dressed in a slim black suit, of the finest fabric I had ever laid eyes on handed me a pair of goggles. The ominous glow was unlike anything from my time, or the present one. The man held them firmly in his grasp for a brief moment and uttered, "You must find her," and slowly faded from existence.</p>

<p>The style of this code is based on a <code>Model/View</code> pattern: The models (another name for classes that deal with data only) take care updating their information, in this case, the wobble or position of rotation of a light segment. The model's don't need to know about how many leds there are in a circle. The <code>Views</code> gather their respective <code>Models</code> and render them to the NeoPixel strands.</p>

<p>This code is object oriented and tries to use <code>References</code> over <code>Pointers</code> whenever possible. This helps avoid null (empty) links to other objects. Read more at <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/101-constructor-initialization-lists/">http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/101-constructor-initialization-lists/</a> and <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/17820/">http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/17820/</a> to see why the constructors look like they do.</p>

<p>The Spot class has <code>virtual</code> in front of its <code>update()</code> method, this makes sure the proper method is called on its subclasses instead of the original method.</p>

<p>The <code>#IFNDEF SOMETHING_HERE</code> lines you see in the header files solve an annoying situation in C/C++ where including a header in multiple places gives a warning that whatever is in it has been defined twice.</p>
