/* TODO

   SHORTLIST
   ---------
   * speed ratio (per second?)
   * move themes into separate methods/files
   * blending
   * fading
   * width to percent
   * abstract color
   * colorer
   ---------

   theme load/unload so we can swap every 10 seconds

   eye 'render' code which does blend, or average or subtract/multiple
   render black masks as a color

   sub pixel rendering..
   'clear' fading.
   width
   speed

   pulser (frequency of human breath.. like macbook)
   color changer
   blinker (duty cycle)
   sparkler (random position)
   throbber (widens and shrinks)
   rainbow bar

   combining multiple features
   avoid update and add? static list of updates to run, pass in eye to each constructor (might be easier to share themes)
   convert 8ts to 16ts for longer segments

   state based modification of the leds? to avoid needing permutations, you just have each one do something to the whole set..
   ie color it, rotatet it, mask off portions of it ?

   different signatures for each?

   multiplier? so a wobbler could overlap a few rotations.. and seemingly 'fast' wind

   theme:
    3 dots evenly spread, circling with a trail
    4 dots doing a small wiggle with a trail

   theme:
    large static 1/2 arc with another half circle color blending

   theme:
    each eye has a grower on opposite sides
