/* TODO

   SHORTLIST
   ---------
   * move themes into separate methods/files
   * fading
   * width to percent
   * abstract color
   * colorer
   * amplitude multiply
   ---------

   - theme load/unload so we can swap every 10 seconds
   - eye 'render' code which does blend, or average or subtract/multiple
   - render black masks as a color

   pulser (frequency of human breath.. like macbook)
   color changer
   blinker (duty cycle)
   sparkler (random position)
   throbber (widens and shrinks)
   rainbow bar

   - avoid update and add? static list of updates to run, pass in eye to each constructor (might be easier to share themes)
   - convert 8ts to 16ts for longer segments
   - combining multiple features or state based modification of the leds? to avoid needing permutations, you just have each one do something to the whole array of color
     or a spot has all the attributes and you assign it various 'affectors'
     (ie color it, rotatet it, mask off portions of it ?)
   - different signatures for each type?
   - multiplier? so a wobbler could overlap a few rotations.. and seemingly 'fast' wind or only rotate 50%

   theme:
    3 dots evenly spread, circling with a trail
    4 dots doing a small wiggle with a trail

   theme:
    large static 1/2 arc with another half circle color blending

   theme:
    each eye has a grower on opposite sides

   theme:
    half circler with faster half circler underneath it
